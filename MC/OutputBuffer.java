 * The output buffer is used for "forwarding" some information to other parts, which is a very general definition.

 * An output buffer called "OperationOutputBuffer" is used to decompose and distribute an operation to the corresponding
 * sensorimotor channel for execution.

 * Currently, this class almost contains nothing.
